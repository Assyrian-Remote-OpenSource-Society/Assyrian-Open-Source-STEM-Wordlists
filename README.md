# Assyrian Open-Source STEM Wordlists

The purpose of this repository is to provide extensive Assyrian wordlists for different STEM topics, given that it's extremely difficult to obtain modern Assyrian textbooks from Assyria (the Northern Iraq region).

This is meant to be a collaborative, open-source effort. And, at this time, the wordlists are in text format and they have not been sorted.

Additionally, some non-STEM topics will be initiated in this repository; however, it should be expected that a different repository will be created for them.
