# Assyrian Open-Source STEM Wordlists

The purpose of this repository is to provide extensive Assyrian wordlists for different STEM topics, given that it's extremely difficult to obtain modern Assyrian textbooks from Assyria (the Northern Iraq region) at this time.

## Motivation

Writing a modern Mathematics or Physics textbook in Assyrian is a difficult endeavor for any Assyrian who is only familiar with the respective terminology in English, Arabic, Farsi, and/or any other language.

Finding, selecting, and compiling words is a time-consuming process, which could slow down an author who is not already familiar with the Assyrian vocabulary for the respective topic. With the existence of pre-compiled wordlists, authors of modern Assyrian STEM textbooks can produce their work at a much faster rate.

## Contribution

This is meant to be a collaborative, open-source effort. And, at this time, the wordlists are in text format and they have not been sorted.

## Additional Notes

Non-STEM topics will be initiated in this repository; however, it should be expected that different repositories will be created for them at some point (by anyone).
