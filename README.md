# Assyrian Open-Source STEM Wordlists

The purpose of this repository is to provide extensive Assyrian wordlists for different STEM topics, given that it's extremely difficult to obtain modern Assyrian textbooks from Assyria (the Northern Iraq region) at this time.

## Motivation

Writing a modern Mathematics or Physics textbook in Assyrian is a difficult endeavor for any Assyrian who is only familiar with the respective terminology in English, Arabic, Farsi, and/or any other language.

Finding, selecting, and compiling words is a time-consuming process, which could slow down an author who is not already familiar with the Assyrian vocabulary for the respective topic. With the existence of pre-compiled wordlists, authors of modern Assyrian STEM textbooks can produce their work at a much faster rate.

## Scope

Each word should have the Assyrian spelling, phonetic in English (pronunciation), and English definition.

## Phonetics

a - ah - as in "bad" <BR>
aa - uh - as in "tall" <BR>
o - oh - as in "pole" <BR>
oo as in "good" <BR>
e - eh - as in "tell" <BR>
ee as in "feel" <BR>
i - ih - as in "till" <BR>

An apostrophe, ', indicates a quick pause in the word, which is natural to anyone who speaks any level of modern Assyrian Neo-Aramaic.

q is used for the qop, ܩ, sound - such as "qasha" (the word commonly used to refer to a priest) or qedala (neck)
kh is used for the kheth, ܚ, sound - such as "khela" (strength, might, power) or khilda (error, incorrect, wrong)

## Formatting

Currently, the wordlists are in text format and they have not been sorted yet. A more visually consumable format will be given to the wordlists, eventually. Initiating the effort has higher priority.

## Contribution

This is meant to be a collaborative, open-source effort. Contribute in any way that you can.

## Limitation

Please do not include any loan words. This may be a difficult endeavor, but all words should be Akkadian, Aramaic, or an amalgamation of the two. It's understandable that some words are actually names of inventions, so those may be included where there is no Assyrian alternative.

Arabic words are often obvious, but Turkish and Greek words may not be as obvious to many. So it's anticipated that some loan words will make it through until they are detected and replaced with Assyrian words.

## Additional Notes

Non-STEM topics will be initiated in this repository; however, it should be expected that different repositories will be created for them at some point (by anyone).
